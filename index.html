                            The purpose of this website is to introduce Helen Foster Snow and her legacy to the modern world.
                            I have included an animation visualizing her travels, a simplified timeline of her life, and hope to 
                            later finish developing an interactive map with photographs taken from the HBLL's "Helen Foster Snow Papers."
                            My primary motivation was to simplify the story presented in her own account of her life found in <i>My China Years</i>.
                            Helen published the memoir more than 40 years after returning from China, and as was only natural,
                            added in many of her own contemporary thoughts as well as details about the future lives of the Chinese
                            people she met and worked with. While this undoubtably enrichens our understanding of her life and legacy,
                            it complicates the timeline of the story she shares. I hope that the animations and other features included
                            in this site are able to communicate Helen's legacy in an understandable and respectful way.

                                        Helen entered Shanghai in the August of 1931 aboard the <i> S.S. President Lincoln.</i> Upon arrival, 
                                        Helen took up residence at the famed Astor House - as "was in the American Tradition" (<i>My China Years</i>, 21). She was lucky to arrive before the
                                        disastrous Japanese invasion of 1932 as she was able to personally witness the beautiful foreign-owned Bund.
                                        Although Helen would grow frustrated with many of the other foreigners residing in the concessions, there was a certain Edgar that caught her eye.

They traveled to Japan for the wedding because Helen didn't "want to be married in a filthy, dirty place like Shanghai"(<i>My China Years</i>, 74). They honeymooned in Japan, Borneo, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Macao before briefly returning to Shanghai before their exodus to Beijing. They also visited the city of Tianjin before settling in their new home in Beijing. </p>

They initially stayed in a bridal suite at the classy French Grand Hotelde Pekin and later moved into a rental at rented a house at No. 21 Mei Cha Hudong. After the honeymoon phase ended, the Snows relationship blossomed into a true partnership, motivating each other with their work and publications. Helen seemed to love their time in Beijing, recounting stories of cocktail parties, studying Chinese, and taking walks on the many "walls within walls" (<i>My China Years</i>, 89). It was also in Beijing where the Snows hosted artists, students, and other controversial figures in their home.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">While there was something of a precedent of Student mobilizing against the Chinese government, Helen was instrumental in lighting the flame that was the December 1935 Student Movement. Helen not only hosted the Yanjing University's student government in her home, she instructed them on "propaganda" and consulted on their plans. Balancing her role as a journalist with her passionate activism, she took pictures of the protest from the sidelines. The Student Movement Helen consulted lit a wildfire across China and likely contributed to the infamous Young Marshall's drastic ideological change.</p>

After receiving a letter from Edgar describing Mao and his army, Helen decided to go collect some stories of her own the following September. Although Helen did not make it to Red China this time around, she arrived in Xi’an at the height of the Young Marshal’s conspiracy. In October 1936 when Helen arrived, Zhang Xueliang, Chiang Kai-Shek’s right-hand man and Young Marshal, was ready to make public his break from the KMT’s anti-communist stance. Helen helped publish his official statements pushing for cooperation with the CCP, thus contributing to the tension that led to the Xi’an Incident and the Second United Front that followed.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Determined to see the Red Front with her own eyes, Helen began her second attempt to visit Yanan. Leaving Beijing on April 21, 1937, Helen Foster Snow made her obligatory stop in Xi’an, arriving on April 23 after the two-day train trip. Upon arrival, Helen was forced to stay at the Xi’an Guest House and given four “bodyguards” to ensure she did not venture to the Red Front. Against all odds, Helen successfully escaped on April 29 with the help of Kempton Fitch and others. After just ten days of travel, Helen successfully made it to the Red Front on April 30, 1937. For the next several months, Helen would interview, befriend, and observe the Red Army and its leadership. Among those she interviewed were Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai. The stories she collected in 1937 were integral to her both her own <i>Inside Red China</i> and Edgar’s <i>Red Star Over China</i>.</p>

Passing through Tianjin on her way to Beijing, Helen noticed the toll the city had already taken by the Japanese Invasion. On October 17th, Helen finally found herself inside the familiar walls of Beijing, “the Nothern Capital.”</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> After leaving Beijing on November 21, 1937, Helen Foster Snow arrived in the south to find a very different scene than the one she saw in 1931. “Shanghai was still burning” from the Chinese resistance to the Japanese invasion, a resistance that had ended two weeks earlier (<i>My China Years</i>, 299). Noticing the swarms of unemployed refugees and destroyed factories that the war left in its wake, Helen’s humanitarian heart burst. She dreamed of Industrial Cooperatives breathing life back into the Chinese economy, and in 1938 her brainchild was brought to life as the INDUSCO movement was born. Helen collaborated with her newfound friend Rewi Alley and the prominent Soong Sisters to cross political divides in China to make the Cooperatives possible.</p>
