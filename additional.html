                            The China Helen Foster Snow visited in 1978 was a very different from the China she knew in the 1930s. China has continued to change over the past three decades (see the animation below) and, like the rest of the world, will continue to change. In order to understand Helen and her incredible legacy, it is necessary that we first understand the world in which she lived.

                             When Helen landed in Shanghai in 1931, China was still in the thrall of their "Century of Humiliation" (百年屈辱).
                             The "Century of Humiliation" was a period of Western imperialism and subjugation beginning with the British invasion
                             during the First Opium War in the 1840s. Japan, France, and other Western countries followed to stake their claims in the "exotic Orient."
                              As a result of this colonization, foreigners had a very unique and protected status in China during the 1930s.

                                        After years of subjugation and colonization following the Sino-Japanese War of the 1890s, Japan escalated its aggression by invading Manchuria in the Fall of 1931. Their invasion on September 18th would have been mere weeks after Helen’s arrival to Shanghai. After solidifying control of the state in February 1932, Japan continued to seek expansion. Helen was well acquainted with the controversy over the KMT’s withdrawal from Manchuria and lack of resistance to Japan [See Student Movement - 1935]. Japanese aggression in the 1930s would eventually escalate to what we know as World War II.

Just 4 years before Helen landed in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-Shek led the KMT in a bloody purge of Communists known as the “White Terror” or “April 12 Purge.” In so doing, he ended the First United Front, a tenuous alliance between the KMT and the CCP (China’s nationalist and communist parties, respectively) to consolidate northern China. Tensions remained high between the surviving Communists and the still reigning KMT nationalists during Helen’s decade in China. Despite its entering into another tenuous alliance - the Second United Front - in 1936 to fight the Japanese, the Communists never accepted KMT authority. After officially being reorganized into the Fourth and Eighth armies under the KMT’s command, the Red Army continued to act on its own accord. After years of territorial squabbles, the Second United Front fell apart in 1941 due to the infamous New Fourth Army Incident.

On December 12, 1936, Zhang Xueliang 張學良 (the Young Marshal) and Yang Hucheng 楊虎城 captured their commanding officer, General Chiang Kai-shek. They demanded that the KMT focus their military efforts on fighting the Japanese in northern China rather than fighting a Civil War with the Communists. After negotiations involving the famous Communist Zhou Enlai and Chiang Kai-shek’s wife Soong Mei-ling, Chiang Kai-shek agreed to the ceasefire and was released on Christmas Day 1936. The KMT would later imprison Zhang Xueliang for his involvement in the Xi’an incident. The Young Marshal remained under house arrest - on the mainland and then Taiwan when the KMT fled - for over 50 years.

Most poignant of the historical distinctions, communism was viewed and practiced differently in China during the 1930s. When Helen Foster Snow and her husband Edgar Snow interacted with Mao Zedong and other prominent leaders, they had just completed the fabled Long March across 9,000 kilometers of China. Although Chinese communism had roots in the urban centers of Shanghai and Beijing, the movement was supported by rural populations by the time Helen met them. The ideology of the time was far more concerned with liberating peasants than it was with any “Great Leap Forward” or becoming the greatest economy in the world. In addition, the Soviets, despite helping form the CCP, supported the KMT’s authority in China and clashed with the CCP.

Now a modern megacity, the city is made up of “walls within walls,” or the concentric circles that have become the modern ring roads. Beijing has long been a scholarly city of culture, known recently for hosting two Olympic Games.

                                    Hong Kong has long served as a bridge between China and the West. Ignoring brief periods of maritime trade bans, the region has enjoyed almost 500 years of trade with Europe. The region now known as Hong Kong became a British colony after the Opium Wars and remained with the UK until 1997. In 1997, Hong Kong was given back to China on the terms that its political and economical systems could continue for 50 years. These terms were called into question during the 2019 protests.

                                    Meaning “the Southern Capital,” Nanjing was the capital city of several dynasties - including the post-Qing dynasty Republic of China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (WWII), the residents of Nanjing were brutally massacred by Japanese forces in what became known as the “Rape of Nanjing.” Although Nanjing is not the capital of the ruling People’s Republic of China, Nanjing remains an important and historic city.

                                    Shanghai has long been considered a global center of trade. Its rich ports drew the attention of Britain and many other Western countries starting in the 19th century. Shortly thereafter, the Eight-Nation Alliance carved Shanghai into many separate concessions. In 1932, Japan invaded and took control of the city outside the concessions. Today, it is a modern megacity with over 28 million inhabitants.

                                    The region formerly known as Bao’an was split by British occupation following the Opium Wars. The southern portion of the former Bao’an county became Hong Kong, and Shenzhen the area at the border. It is now a special economic zone that flourishes due to its prime location between Hong Kong and Guang Dong.

                                    Due to its access to Beijing, the Yellow River, and the ocean, Tianjin has long been considered an important port. Control of the city was fought over by foreign powers throughout the late 19th century. Tianjin is now the fourth largest city in China with a population of over 12 million people.

                                    The ancient city is well-known for the terracotta warriors that guard the tomb of the First Emporer of China just a few miles east. During the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 that led to the Republic of China, the 20,000 Manchus living in Xi’an were brutally massacred. The city later served as a sort of border between KMT-controlled China and Red China.

                                    After the Long March from Jiangxi in the South, Yanan became the Red Capital, the center of Communist forces in China, for over a decade. It is heralded as the birthplace of the Communist Revolution. During WWII, most of the buildings in Yanan were destroyed and its residents had to live in caves carved in the hillsides.
